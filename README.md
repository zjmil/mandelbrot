# Mandelbrot

This is a simple [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
renderer. It uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) for rendering.


### Building
All that's needed to build is SDL2 and a C compiler.

SDL2 and SDL2_gfx can be installed on macOS with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_gfx

```

Then the binary can be built by simply running:
```bash
make
```
